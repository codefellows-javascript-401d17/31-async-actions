HI!!!!

This is my react app that calls out to an API. The API is simple and only has a single resource. It has 4 endpoints to put, post, delete and get category items. However, the get route returns ALL categories.
The first form takes a title and a budget in the inputs. The budget input MUST be a number greater than 0.
